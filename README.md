# Digital Image Archiving System

A Streamlit application for digitizing and enhancing old laminated/polaroid photographs. The system uses computer vision algorithms (OpenCV) and AI-powered analysis (Anthropic Claude) to automatically remove glare, correct perspective distortion, restore faded colors, reduce noise, and compress images to target sizes while maintaining quality. Features include AI orientation detection, polaroid content extraction, interactive before/after comparisons, and comprehensive quality metrics (PSNR/SSIM).

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
